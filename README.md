## Professional Summary

Self-directed and battle-tested researcher specializing in **offensive cybersecurity**, **adversarial machine learning**, and **autonomous defense architectures**.

Contributor to high-signal vulnerability and security research programs, including **Google VRP**, **Microsoft MSRC**, and select private initiatives.

Primary areas of expertise include:
- Nation-state adversary emulation and red team operations  
- LLM red teaming, prompt injection, and AI system subversion  
- Design of resilient, hardened infrastructures  
- Autonomous interception, decision-making, and response platforms  
- AI deception, model exploitation, and multi-agent coordination  

This work blends red team tradecraft, AI engineering, and systems thinking to address threats across **cyber**, **cognitive**, and **autonomous operational domains**.

## Research Domains

### Artificial Intelligence & Adversarial ML
- LLM exploitation and robustness testing  
- Model manipulation, deception, and alignment failure analysis  
- Autonomous agent coordination under adversarial pressure  

### Cybersecurity & Threat Research
- Nation-state and APT tradecraft analysis  
- End-to-end attack chain modeling  
- Living-off-the-land persistence techniques  
- Malware tooling, infrastructure, and OPSEC analysis  

### Autonomous & Distributed Systems
